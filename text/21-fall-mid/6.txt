30. ZOS also later added support for “large” pages, a new and clever idea. Assume that in a given system,
regular page size is usually 1 KB, and large pages are 1 MB. When possible, the OS uses large pages instead
of a bunch of smaller ones (e.g., when there is a contiguous, aligned portion of the virtual address space in
use). Why is using large pages a good idea?
a) They reduce system complexity
b) They speed up trap handling
c) They can increase TLB hit rates
d) They make physical memory allocation easier
e) None of the above
31. ZOS also added special hardware, in the form of general-purpose registers that only the kernel can use.
Indeed, all kernel code has been written to only use these registers, not the regular (user-level) general
purpose ones. Why might these registers for the kernel be a good idea?
a) Faster trapping into and returning from the kernel
b) Kernel code now easier to compile
c) Reduces need for context switching between processes
d) Now, no way to harm user-level register contents while in kernel code
e) None of the above
32. Zinus also had this last question for you: which is true about operating systems?
a) They always make systems run faster
b) They always make systems use less memory and CPU
c) They generally make systems easier to use
d) They never crash
e) None of the above (these are all false)
