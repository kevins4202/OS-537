Question 16: You have a suspicion that the STL cannot hold all mapping entries in device memory; as a result, sometimes when reading from disk, an extra read is incurred (to look up the mapping information). The workload used here is to repeatedly read some number of blocks N (many times), and report the average time per read; N is increased along the x-axis. Which line on the graph best reflects this result?
a) Lowest line with drop halfway
b) Next lowest dashed line line with drop halfway  
c) Solid line with rise halfway
d) Topmost line which goes up then down
e) None of the above

For questions 17, 18, and 19, the graph is a disk with three rings: The outermost ring contains 0 to 11 inclusive. The next inner ring contains 12 to 23, inclusive. The third ring contains 24 to 35, inclusive. 

Question 17: Assuming a FIFO scheduling policy, and  a request stream which reads blocks 21, 17, 11, 7, 13,  what is the last block to be read?
a) 21
b) 17
c) 11
d) 7
e) 13

Question 18: Assume a SSTF scheduling  policy, and a VERY FAST seek. What is the last block read?
a) 21 
b) 17 
c) 11 
d) 7
e) 13


Question 19: Same question, but assume SATF scheduling policy, and a VERY FAST seek. What is the last block read?
a) 21
b) 17
c) 11 
d) 7 
e) 13


Question 20: In a shingled disk, all writes are log-structured. Specifically, writes are directed to the currently- being-written shingle, and the STL is updated accordingly. As a result, does disk scheduling of write requests (assuming a workload only contains write requests) help performance?
a) Yes (always)
b) Yes (sometimes)
c) No (never)
d) Canâ€™t answer without more details 
e) None of the above

Question 21: A file descriptor is:
a) a system-wide object used to access files
b) a per-process integer used to access files
c) readily forged
d) returned to a process via the close() system call
e) hard to understand
