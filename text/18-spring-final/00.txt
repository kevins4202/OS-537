Question 1: For a specific RAID array (call it “RAID A”), a read of a block takes about 10ms. A write of a block also takes about 10ms. This RAID is likely:
a) RAID-1 (mirroring)
b) RAID-4 (parity disk)
c) RAID-5 (rotating parity)
d) RAID-4 or RAID-5
e) All of the above

Question 2: for “RAID B”, two small random writes usually take about twice as long as one random write. This RAID is likely:
a) RAID-1 (mirroring)
b) RAID-4 (parity disk)
c) RAID-5 (rotating parity)
d) RAID-4 or RAID-5
e) All of the above

Question 3: for “RAID C”, a large write (of 7 blocks) usually takes about as much time as a small write (1 block). This RAID is likely:
a) RAID-1 (mirroring)
b) RAID-4 (parity disk)
c) RAID-5 (rotating parity)
d) RAID-4 or RAID-5
e) All of the above


Question 4: For “RAID D”, the overall throughput (measured in MB/s) is about 4 MB/s when issuing many 1- block random writes. In comparison, a comparable RAID array configured to use striping (RAID-0) achieved a throughout of about 8 MB/s. This RAID (RAID D) is likely:
a) RAID-1 (mirroring)
b) RAID-4 (parity disk)
c) RAID-5 (rotating parity) 
d) RAID-4 or RAID-5
e) All of the above

Question 5: for “RAID E”, the overall throughput when writing large sequential blocks to disk is about 700 MB/ s. In comparison, large sequential writes to a RAID 0 achieves about 800 MB/s. This RAID (RAID-E) is likely: a) RAID-1 (mirroring)
b) RAID-4 (parity disk)
c) RAID-5 (rotating parity)
d) RAID-4 or RAID-5
e) All of the above

For the next part of the RAID question, you discover a new forensic tool: the ability to measure the number of physical I/Os that happen in the system (you do this by attaching probes to the internal I/O busses of the RAID array in question; nice work!).
Question 6: For “RAID F”, you know that the RAID is likely RAID-4 or RAID-5. You issue a single perfectly aligned block write. The number of physical I/Os you measure on RAID F during this write is:
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2 
d) 3
e) 4

Question 7: For “RAID G”, you have already figured out that it is likely a RAID-1 (mirroring). You then issue a single write to the RAID. The write is small (1 block) is aligned. The number of physical I/Os you measure on the disks of RAID G is always:
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) Sometimes =2, sometimes >2
e) Always > 2

Question 8: For “RAID H”, you have already figured out that it is likely a RAID-1 (mirroring). You then issue a single write to the RAID. The write is small (1 block); however, it is not necessarily aligned. The number of physical I/Os you measure on the disks of RAID H is always:
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) Sometimes =2, sometimes >2 
e) Always > 2
