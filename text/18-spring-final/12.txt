Question 76: You are now given some new information about a particular system. Specifically, this system has 1 MB linear page table size (per process), and has a 1KB page size. Assuming page table entry size is 4 bytes, how many bits are in the virtual page number (VPN) on this system?
a) 28
b) 18
c) 8
d) 32
e) None of the above


Lastly, you are given some memory dumps, which tell you something about the contents of memory. In this dump, you find that the system only has 3 pages, that pages 3, 4, and 5 are in memory. You also check a history log and find that the last 10 pages accessed were 8, 7, 4, 2, 5, 4, 7, 3, 4, 5 (in that order, with 5 being most recently accessed). 

Question 77: You are then asked to determine which replacement policy was used. Is it: 
a) FIFO
b) LRU
c) MRU
d) LFU
e) Cannot tell from the given information

With the same situation as above (3-page system, with 3, 4, 5 in memory, and the last 10 pages accessed are 8, 7, 4, 2, 5, 4, 7, 3, 4, 5), you are asked the following few questions.

Question 78: Assuming the replacement policy was FIFO, how many misses were encountered while those last 10 pages were accessed? (assume the memory was empty to begin)
a) 7
b) 8
c) 9
d) 10
e) None of the above

Question 79: Assuming the replacement policy was LRU, how many misses were encountered while those last 10 pages were accessed? (assume the memory was empty to begin)
a) 7
b) 8
c) 9
d) 10
e) None of the above

Question 80: Assuming the replacement policy was OPT (the optimal replacement policy), how many misses were encountered while those last 10 pages were accessed? (assume the memory was empty to begin)
a) 7
b) 8
c) 9
d) 10
e) None of the above
