Problem IX: Assume, for the following jobs, a FIFO scheduler and only one CPU. Each job has a “required” runtime, which means the job needs that many time units on the CPU to complete.
Job A arrives at time=0, required runtime=X time units
Job B arrives at time=5, required runtime=Y time units
Job C arrives at time=10, required runtime=Z time units

Assuming an average turnaround time between 10 and 20 time units (inclusive), which of the following run times for A, B, and C are possible?
To answer: Fill in A for possible, B for not possible.

41. A=10, B=10, C=10 
42. A=20, B=20, C=20 
43. A=5, B=10, C=15 
44. A=20, B=30, C=40 
45. A=30, B=1, C=1

Problem X: Assume the following schedule for a set of three jobs, A, B, and C:
A runs first (for 10 time units) but is not yet done
B runs next (for 10 time units) but is not yet done
C runs next (for 10 time units) and runs to completion
A runs to completion (for 10 time units)
B runs to completion (for 5 time units)

Which scheduling disciplines could allow this schedule to occur? To answer: Fill in A for possible, B for not possible.
46. FIFO
47. Round Robin
48. STCF (Shortest Time to Completion First) 
49. Multi-level Feedback Queue
50. Lottery Scheduling

Problem XI: The Multi-level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) is a fancy scheduler that does lots of things. Which of the following things could you possibly say (correctly!) about the MLFQ approach?
To answer: Fill in A for things that are true about MLFQ, B for things that are not true about MLFQ.

51. MLFQ learns things about running jobs
52. MLFQ starves long running jobs
53. MLFQ uses different length time slices for jobs
54. MLFQ uses round robin
55. MLFQ forgets what it has learned about running jobs sometimes

Problem XII: The simplest technique for virtualizing memory is known as dynamic relocation, or “base- and-bounds”. Assuming the following system characteristics:
- a 1KB virtual address space
- a base register set to 10000
- a bounds register set to 100

Which of the following physical memory locations can be legally accessed by the running program?
To answer: Fill in A for legally accessible locations, B for locations not legally accessible by this program.

56. 0 
57. 1000
58. 10000
59. 10050
60. 10100

Problem XIII: Assuming the same set-up as above (1 KB virtual address space, base=10000, bounds=100), which of the following virtual addresses can be legally accessed by the running program? (i.e., which are valid?)
To answer: Fill in A for valid virtual addresses, B for not valid ones.

61. 0 
62. 1000 
63. 10000 
64. 10050
65. 10100
