(a) platter
(b) surface
(c) track
(d) sector

For questions 5, the graph is a disk with three rings: The outermost ring contains 0 to 11 inclusive. The next inner ring contains 12 to 23, inclusive. The third ring contains 24 to 35, inclusive. 

5. In the next four (5-8) questions, the Word Thief has hacked the disk simulator! What a clever
hacker, this Word Thief is. What’s missing? Well, unsurprisingly, it’s the solutions!

(b) 4
(c) 35
(d) 34
(e) 5
