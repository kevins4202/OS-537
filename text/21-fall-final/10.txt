55. “During a file open, many ________ requests will likely be made to the server.”
(a) NFSPROC_RMDIR
(b) NFSPROC_MKDIR
(c) NFSPROC_LOOKUP
(d) NFSPROC_REMOVE
(e) NFSPROC_FLUSH
56. “An operation is called idempotent when the effect of performing the operation ______ is
equivalent to the effect of performing the operation a single time.”
(a) never
(b) once
(c) silently
(d) many times
(e) in reverse
57. “NFS clients handle network packet losses and server crashes uniformly by using a
_______ approach.”
(a) caching
(b) oddly efficient
(c) redundancy-based
(d) timeout/retry
(e) handshake/fistbump
58. “NFS clients use caches to improve performance. However, keeping caches consistent is a
great challenge. Two primary subproblems of cache consistency are _______.”
(a) latency/staleness
(b) visibility/correctness
(c) choiceness/visibility
(d) correctness/staleness
(e) staleness/visibility
59. “NFS clients buffer writes in memory for some time before flushing them to the server.
However, if a client closes a file, all dirty blocks in the client cache are flushed to the server.
This ‘flush on close’ behavior addresses the _______ problem.”
(a) latency
(b) staleness
(c) correctness
(d) visibility
(e) choiceness
60. “NFS servers also have a cache, but must flush writes to disk immediately before returning
success to clients. The reason for this is ________.”
(a) performance; this approach is usually faster
(b) correctness; this ensures no writes are lost due to an untimely server crash
(c) choiceness; having more choice is critical in the modern world
(d) caching in both clients and servers adds too much complexity to the protocol
(e) lost to history
