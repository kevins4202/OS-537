39. The Word Thief even hacked the VSFS homework! Now it won’t provide solutions. Fill in the
missing solution below. Remember an inode in the simulator contains the following three
things: [filetype address-of-data reference-count]
Initial State:
inode bitmap 10000000
inodes [d a:0 r:2][][][][][][][]
data bitmap 10000000
data [(.,0) (..,0)][][][][][][][]
______ // this is the operation that took place, what is it?
Final State:
inode bitmap 11000000
inodes [d a:0 r:2][f a:-1 r:1][][][][][][]
data bitmap 10000000
data [(.,0) (..,0) (m,1)][][][][][][][]
(a) creat(“/m”)
(b) mkdir(“/m”)
(c) unlink(“/m”)
(d) append a block to root directory
(e) append a block to root inode

40. Continuing from the above (Q39), one more operation took place, leading to this final state:
Final State:
inode bitmap 11000000
inodes [d a:0 r:2][f a:-1 r:2][][][][][][]
data bitmap 10000000
data [(.,0) (..,0) (m,1) (o,1)][][][][][][][]
What operation was it?
(a) mkdir(“/o”)
(b) unlink(“/m”)
(c) read(“/m”)
(d) link("/m", "/o");
(e) creat(“/o”)

Journaling
The Write Thief actually likes to journal, taking time all day long to write down some thoughts.
What are those thoughts about, you ask? Thieving, of course! And here, the Write Thief is
removing knowledge about File System Journaling!
41. In discussing crash scenarios during a single data-block append to a file, one crash
scenario occurs when “just the data block is written to disk. In this case, ______”
(a) the data is on disk, but it can never be read
(b) the data is on disk, and can be read after recovery, but it is garbage
(c) the data is on disk, but the inode bitmap says it is free
(d) the data is on disk, and it can be easily read after recovery
(e) the data never reaches the disk
42. In that same scenario (single block append), another case arises when “just the updated
inode is written to disk. In this case, ______”
(a) the data is on disk, but it can never be read
(b) the data may seemingly be read after recovery, but it is garbage
(c) the data bitmap and inode bitmap don’t agree
(d) the data is on disk, and can be easily read after recovery
(e) the inode cannot be read
