12. “More generally, a mirrored system (with mirroring level of 2) can tolerate 1 disk failure for
certain, and up to ______ failures depending on which disks fail.” [Assume here there are N
disks in the system]
(a) 2
(b) N/4
(c) N/2
(d) N/3
(e) N

13. “Thus, we can conclude that the maximum bandwidth obtained during sequential writing to
a 2-way mirrored array is ______” [Assume here there are N disks, and that a single disk
delivers S MB/s of disk bandwidth]
(a) S MB/s
(b) 2 x S MB/s
(c) N x S MB/s
(d) N x S / 2 MB/s
(e) N x S x S MB/s

14. “For example, in RAID-4, if we had blocks of size 2 bits (yes, this is still quite a bit smaller
than a 4KB block, but you get the picture), they might look something like this:
Block0 Block1 Block2 Block3 Parity”
00 10 11 10 _____
(a) 00
(b) 01
(c) 10
(d) 11
(e) None of the above

15. “RAID-4 uses a disk for parity information for every group of disks it is protecting. Thus, our
useful capacity for a RAID group is ______.” [Assume N disks, and B bytes of data per disk]
(a) N x B
(b) N
(c) B
(d) N x (B - 1)
(e) (N - 1) x B

16. “Random read performance of RAID-5 (as compared to RAID-4) is ______”
(a) a little better
(b) a little worse
(c) a lot better
(d) a lot worse
(e) about the same

17. “RAID Level(s) _____ encounter(s) the ‘small write’ problem.”
(a) 0
(b) 1
(c) 4
(d) 5
(e) 4 and 5
