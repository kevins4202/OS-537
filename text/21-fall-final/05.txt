28. After the five writes above took place, assume the FTL has the following contents:
12->4 14->3 29->2 37->0 39->1
What data value will be returned if the user issues a read to block 29?
(a) q
(b) i
(c) U
(d) K
(e) z

29. After the first five writes (as shown above), assume the next five writes are to blocks 12, 20,
30, 39, and 50. After these writes, how many pages in the SSD will be live?
(a) 7
(b) 8
(c) 9
(d) 10
(e) 11

30. Assuming the same times (erase of a block takes 1000 microseconds, program of a page
takes 40 microseconds), what is the average cost per write for the first 10 writes?
(a) 100 microseconds
(b) 120 microseconds
(c) 140 microseconds
(d) 200 microseconds
(e) 1040 microseconds

31. “The ______ is the generic name that is used in many file systems to describe the structure
that holds the metadata for a given file, such as its length, permissions, and the location of its
constituent blocks.”
(a) superblock
(b) inode
(c) data block
(d) directory
(e) journal

32. “Thus, an inode has a fixed number of direct pointers (12), and a single indirect pointer. If a
file grows large enough, an indirect block is allocated (from the data-block region of the disk),
and the inode’s slot for an indirect pointer is set to point to it. Assuming each slot can point to
a 4-KB block, and that disk addresses are 4 bytes, the file can grow to be ______.
(a) 4096 KB
(b) 4100 KB
(c) 4104 KB
(d) 4044 KB
(e) 4144 KB
33. “Let’s examine an example with twelve direct pointers, as well as both a single and a
double indirect block. Assuming a block size of 4 KB, and 4-byte disk addresses, such a file
system can have a max file size of ______ (approximately).”
(a) ~4 KB
(b) ~1 MB
(c) ~4 MB
(d) ~1 GB
(e) ~4 GB
