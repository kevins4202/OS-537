6. Now assume a SSTF (shortest seek first) disk scheduler, and a VERY FAST (essentially infinitely fast) seek; which request would be serviced last? (assume that when you get to a particular track, the scheduler will read the blocks in the fastest order available on that track)
a) 13
(b) 4
(c) 35
(d) 34
(e) 5
7. Now assume a SATF (shortest access first) scheduler, and a VERY FAST (essentially infinitely fast) seek; which request will be serviced last?
a) 13
(b) 4
(c) 35
(d) 34
(e) 5

8. Assuming a VERY FAST seek (essentially infinitely fast), how would you order the disk
schedulers for those five requests, from fastest to slowest?
(a) SSTF, SATF, FIFO
(b) SSTF, FIFO, SATF
(c) SATF, SSTF, FIFO
(d) SATF, FIFO, SSTF
(e) FIFO, SATF, SSTF

9. Now, the Word Thief is back to the usual thieving: removing key words or phrases.
“The three basic components of disk I/O time are ______, _______, and ______.”
(a) transition, position, constitution
(b) move head, wait for head to stop moving, transfer
(c) position, transfer, react
(d) shake, rattle, roll
(e) seek, rotate, transfer

10. “A disk scheduling algorithm that avoids starvation is called ______”
(a) PASS
(b) CRANK
(c) SCAN
(d) CHECK
(e) FAIRPLAY

11. “RAIDs offer a number of advantages over a single disk. One advantage is performance.
Using multiple disks in parallel can greatly speed up I/O times. Another benefit is capacity.
Large data sets demand large disks. Finally, RAIDs can improve ______”
(a) size
(b) the odds
(c) reliability
(d) latency
(e) distribution
