7. Now assume a SATF (shortest access first) scheduler, and a VERY FAST (essentially infinitely fast) seek;
which request will be serviced last?
a) 13
(b) 4
(c) 35
(d) 34
(e) 5
8. Assuming a VERY FAST seek (essentially infinitely fast), how would you order the disk
schedulers for those five requests, from fastest to slowest?
(a) SSTF, SATF, FIFO
(b) SSTF, FIFO, SATF
(c) SATF, SSTF, FIFO
(d) SATF, FIFO, SSTF
(e) FIFO, SATF, SSTF
9. Now, the Word Thief is back to the usual thieving: removing key words or phrases.
“The three basic components of disk I/O time are ______, _______, and ______.”
(a) transition, position, constitution
(b) move head, wait for head to stop moving, transfer
(c) position, transfer, react
(d) shake, rattle, roll
(e) seek, rotate, transfer
10. “A disk scheduling algorithm that avoids starvation is called ______”
(a) PASS
(b) CRANK
(c) SCAN
(d) CHECK
(e) FAIRPLAY
RAID
The Word Thief hates redundant arrays of independent drives (RAID)! Why, you ask? Simple:
Redundancy makes the Word Thief work harder to remove words from the world.
11. “RAIDs offer a number of advantages over a single disk. One advantage is performance.
Using multiple disks in parallel can greatly speed up I/O times. Another benefit is capacity.
Large data sets demand large disks. Finally, RAIDs can improve ______”
(a) size
(b) the odds
(c) reliability
(d) latency
(e) distribution
12. “More generally, a mirrored system (with mirroring level of 2) can tolerate 1 disk failure for
certain, and up to ______ failures depending on which disks fail.” [Assume here there are N
disks in the system]
(a) 2
(b) N/4
(c) N/2
(d) N/3
(e) N
